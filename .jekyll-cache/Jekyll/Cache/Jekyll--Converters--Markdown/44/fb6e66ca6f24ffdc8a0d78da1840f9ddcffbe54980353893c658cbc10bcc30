<h3> Hello, there! </h3>
I am an engineer interested in Human-Computer Interaction, User Experience and Big Data.
<br />
I have received a master's degree in Human Factors Engineering from <a href="http://unist.ac.kr">Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology(UNIST)</a>. There, I joined <a href="http://interactions.unist.ac.kr">Interactions Lab</a> and studied the design space of interactions for technology-supported at-home exercises, advised by Professor Ian Oakley. Prior to this, I received a bachelor's degree in engineering with a specialization in Digital Image Processing and an interdisciplinary degree in Entrepreneurship from <a href="http://cau.ac.kr">Chung-Ang University</a>.
